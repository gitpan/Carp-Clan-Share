VERSION
    Version 0.013

SYNOPSIS
        package My::Namespace

        use Carp::Clan::Share; # My::Namespace::Carp now exists

        ...

        package My::Namespace::Module

        use My::Namespace::Carp; # Acts like "use Carp::Clan qw/^My::Namespace::/;"

        ...

        package My::Other::Namespace;

        # You can also pass options through to Carp::Clan
        use Carp::Clan::Share qw/verbose/; # My::Other::Namespace::Carp now exists

        ...

        package My::Other::Namespace::Module

        use My::Other::Namespace::Carp; # Acts like "use Carp::Clan qw/^My::Other::Namespace:: verbose/;"

        ...

DESCRIPTION
    This is a very lightweight helper module (actually just an import
    method) that will automagically create a __PACKAGE__::Carp module for
    you.

    Any arguments passed to the import (e.g. via use) method are forwarded
    along to Carp::Clan.

    NOTE: If you use this from a package ending with ::Carp, then it will
    use the parent of of that package as the target namespace

        package My::Namespace::Carp;
        
    use Carp::Clan::Share;

        package My::Namespace::Module

        use My::Namespace::Carp; # Acts like "use Carp::Clan qw/^My::Namespace::/;"
